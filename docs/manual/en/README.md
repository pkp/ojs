#OJS 3.0 User Guide

This guide will help you publish journals and issues with Open Journal Systems.

It provides an introductory overview for each stage of the workflow from submission to production. It also provides further background information on some of the configuration options.

When you see **Help** links within the application, they'll open a help panel with the most useful information for that section.

A more detailed look at this software is available in [Learning OJS 3.0](https://www.gitbook.com/book/pkp/ojs3/details).
