## <a name="import-export"></a>Import/Export

The Import/Export tools allow you to move content between OJS installations. You can import and export users, publications and article metadata.

## <a name="statistics"></a>Statistics

The system generates reports that track site usage and submissions over a given period of time. Reports are generated in CSV format which requires a spreadsheet application, like Excel, Google Docs or LibreOffice to view.

You can generate detailed custom reports and filter by complex parameters. If you're unsure about any of the parameters, speak to your technical support team for help.
