OJS 3.4.0 Release Notes
Git tag: 3_4_0-0

Release date: June 9, 2023
============================

Configuration Changes
---------------------

See config.TEMPLATE.inc.php for a description and examples of all supported
configuration parameters.

- The date/time formats in config.inc.php should be converted from the format
  specified in https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php to the format
  specified in https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php. If you're not
  sure how, use the values below. The following settings are affected:
    date_format_short = "Y-m-d"
    date_format_long = "F n, Y"
    datetime_format_short = "Y-m-d h:i A"
    datetime_format_long = "F n, Y - h:i A"
    time_format = "h:i A"
  The old formats will continue to work for now but are deprecated.

- An allowed_hosts option was added to protect against HOST injection attacks.
  We recommend configuring this setting! See https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7649
  for details.

- The captcha.captcha_on_login option for displaying a captcha challenge in
  the login interface has been added (default: on)

- The setting i18n.client_charset was removed. It used to support two options "ISO-8859-1" (LATIN1) and "UTF-8", now we're UTF-8 only.

- The setting i18n.locale will likely need to be updated because locale codes have been standardized. For example, "en_US" has become "en".
    Check the `locale/` directory for a list of available locale codes.

New config.inc.php section for queues is added, with the following parameters:
    - default_connection (default value: database), being the default queue driver to be used;
    - default_queue (default value: queue), being the default queue to be used if someone forgot to associate a queue during Queue::push()
    - disable_jobs_run_at_shutdown (default value: off), being a flag to disable the jobs to run at php shutdown

- The setting general.session_samesite (default value: Lax) has been added to control the "SameSite" setting for the session cookie.

- The setting security.force_ssl, when enabled, will also set the "Secure" flag for the session cookie.

New config.inc.php parameters added for emails:
    - default (default value: sendmail), being the default mailer driver to be used for email delivery
    - sendmail_path (default value: "/usr/sbin/sendmail -bs"), being the path to the sendmail program on the server
