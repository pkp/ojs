Configuration Changes
---------------------

See config.TEMPLATE.inc.php for a description and examples of all supported
configuration parameters.

Changed config.inc.php parameters:
	- mail:smtp_auth: The possible values of this setting have changed from
		PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5 to ssl or tls (or leave
		unspecified to disable SMTP authentication). See the phpmailer
		library's documentation for further details.
	- security:allowed_html: The format of this setting has changed for
		compatibility with HTMLPurifier's HTML.Allowed setting. See
		config.TEMPLATE.inc.php for a sensible default.
	- captcha:captcha: This option has been deprecated in favour of
		ReCaptcha. See config.TEMPLATE.inc.php in the [captcha] section
		for the replacement configuration options.
