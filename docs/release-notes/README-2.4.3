==============================

NOTE: Users who have configured a cron job for their journal should be aware
that upgrading to OJS 2.4.3 will automatically enable the acron plugin, which
is a cron alternative that occasionally processes scheduled tasks using regular
web requests as the trigger. If you are using cron, you should disable the
acron plugin.
