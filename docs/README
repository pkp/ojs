	================================


About
-----
Open Journal Systems (OJS) has been developed by the Public Knowledge Project.
For general information about OJS and other open research systems, visit the PKP
web site at <http://pkp.sfu.ca/>.


License
-------
OJS is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file
docs/COPYING for the complete terms of this license.

Third parties are welcome to modify and redistribute OJS in entirety or parts
according to the terms of this license. PKP also welcomes patches for
improvements or bug fixes to the software.


System Requirements
-------------------
Recommended server requirements:

	* PHP >= 4.2.x (including PHP 5.x); Microsoft IIS requires PHP 5.x
	* MySQL >= 3.23.23 (including MySQL 4.x) or PostgreSQL >= 7.1 (including
	  PostgreSQL 8.x)
	* Apache >= 1.3.2x or >= 2.0.4x or Microsoft IIS 6
	* Operating system: Any OS that supports the above software, including
	  Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, Windows

As PKP does not have the resources to test every possible combination of
software versions and platforms, no guarantee of correct operation or support
is implied. We welcome feedback from users who have deployed OJS on systems
other than those listed above.


Recommended Configuration
-------------------------

A secure deployment can be best achieved by using the following policies:

	* Dedicate a database to OJS; use unique credentials to access it.
	  Configure this database to perform automated backups on a regular
	  basis. Perform a manual backup when upgrading or performing
	  maintenance.

	* Configure OJS (config.inc.php) to use SHA1 hashing rather than MD5.

	* Configure OJS (config.inc.php) to use force_ssl_login so that
	  authenticated users communicate with the server via HTTPS.

	* Install OJS so that the files directory is NOT a subdirectory of
	  the OJS installation and cannot be accessed directly via the web
	  server. Restrict file permissions as much as possible. Automated
	  backups of this directory should be roughly synchronized with
	  database backups.


Installation
------------
Please review this document and the RELEASE document prior to installing OJS.
If you encounter problems, please also see the FAQ document in this directory.

To install OJS:

	1. Extract the OJS archive to the desired location in your web documents
	   directory.
	
	2. Make the following files and directories (and their contents)
	   writeable (i.e., by changing the owner or permissions with chown or
	   chmod):
	   
	     * config.inc.php (optional -- if not writable you will be prompted
	       to manually overwrite this file during installation)
	     * public
	     * cache
	     * cache/t_cache
	     * cache/t_config
	     * cache/t_compile
	     * cache/_db
	
	3. Create a directory to store uploaded files (submission files, etc.)
	   and make this directory writeable. It is recommended that this
	   directory be placed in a non-web-accessible location (or otherwise
	   protected from direct access, such as via .htaccess rules).
	   
	4. Open a web browser to <http://yourdomain.com/path/to/ojs/> and follow
	   the on-screen installation instructions.
	   
	   Alternatively, the command-line installer can be used instead by
	   running the command "php tools/install.php" from your OJS directory.
	   (Note: with the CLI installer you may need to chown/chmod the public
	   and uploaded files directories after installation, if the Apache user
	   is different from the user running the tool.)
	   
	   The installer also offers a "manual installation" option that will
	   display the SQL statements necessary to create the OJS database but
	   not execute them.
	 
	5. Recommended additional steps post-installation:
	
	     * Review config.inc.php for additional configuration settings
	     * Review the FAQ document for frequently asked technical and
	       server configuration questions.


Upgrading
---------
See docs/UPGRADE for information on upgrading from previous OJS 1.x and OJS 2.x
releases.


Localization
------------
To add support for other languages, the following sets of XML files must be
localized and placed in an appropriately named directory (using ISO locale 
codes, e.g. "fr_FR", is recommended):

	* locale/en_US
	* dbscripts/xml/data/locale/en_US
	* help/en_US
	* registry/locale/en_US
	* rt/en_US
	* plugins/[plugin category]/[plugin name]/locale, where applicable

The only critical files that need translation for the system to function
properly are found in locale/en_US, dbscripts/xml/data/locale/en_US, and
registry/locale/en_US.

New locales must also be added to the file registry/locales.xml, after which
they can be installed in the system through the site administration web
interface.
	
Translations can be contributed back to PKP for distribution with future
releases of OJS.

Server requirements for full Unicode (UTF-8) support:

	* MySQL >= 4.1.1 or PostgreSQL >= 7.1
	* PHP >= 4.3.0 compiled with support for the mbstring library


Scheduled Tasks
---------------
OJS supports a mechanism to execute a variety of tasks at scheduled times
(such as automatic sending of reminder notification emails).

To enable support for using scheduled tasks, edit your config.inc.php and
set the scheduled_tasks setting to On, and set up your operating system to
periodically execute (as the same user your webserver is running under) the
PHP script found at tools/runScheduledTasks.php in your OJS directory:

On *nix operating systems, this can be done by adding a simple cron task:
	# crontab -e www
	0 * * * *	php /path/to/ojs2/tools/runScheduledTasks.php
In this example the script would be executed every hour.

On Windows XP systems, this can be done by using the Windows Task Scheduler:
	1) From the Control Panel, double-click on Scheduled Tasks.
	2) Right-click within the Scheduled Tasks window and choose:
		New > Scheduled Task
	3) Under the Task tab, in the Run field, enter:
		php c:\path\to\ojs2\tools\runScheduledTasks.php
	4) You will also be asked to specify the folder to start this task in
	   (which will usually be the folder that PHP was installed into) and
	   the user under which the task will be executed as.
	5) Under Schedule tab and the Settings tab, you can more specifically
	   configure the task. For example, you can choose start and end dates
	   for this scheduled task and also how often to execute this task.
	   
If using the scheduled tasks script, it is recommended that the script be
set up to execute at least once per day.

Note that using the script also requires you to have the PHP command-line
interpreter installed on your server.


Third-party Libraries
