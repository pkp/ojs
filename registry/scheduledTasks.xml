  * This file lists all scheduled tasks to be executed by the system.
  *
  * Note that this functionality requires scheduled task support to be enabled.
  * The degree of granularity supported for the task frequency depends on the
  * frequency the scheduled task script itself is scheduled to run (as
  * configured in cron, for example).
  *
  * Example task:
  *
  * <task class="submission.scheduledTask.ReviewReminderTask">
  * 	<descr>Send reviewer reminder emails, once per hour.</descr>
  * 	<frequency minute="0"/>
  * </task>

		  * The primary difference with crontab entries is that the task
