 * @mainpage OJS API Reference
 * 
 * Welcome to the OJS API Reference. This resource contains documentation
 * generated automatically from the OJS source code. 
 * 
 * The design of Open %Journal Systems 2.x is heavily structured for maintainability,  
 * flexibility and robustness. For this reason it may seem complex when first  
 * approached. Those familiar with Sun's Enterprise Java Beans technology or the  
 * Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern will note many similarities. 
 * 
 * As in a MVC structure, data storage and representation, user interface  
 * presentation, and control are separated into different layers. The major  
 * categories, roughly ordered from "front-end" to "back-end," follow: 
 * - Smarty templates, which are responsible for assembling HTML pages to  
 * display to users; 
 * - Page classes, which receive requests from users' web browsers, delegate any  
 * required processing to various other classes, and call up the appropriate  
 * Smarty template to generate a response; 
 * - Action classes, which are used by the Page classes to perform non-trivial  
 * processing of user requests; 
 * - Model classes, which implement PHP objects representing the system's  
 * various entities, such as Users, Articles, and Journals; 
 * - Data Access Objects (DAOs), which generally provide (amongst others)  
 * update, create, and delete functions for their associated Model classes, are  
 * responsible for all database interaction; 
 * - Support classes, which provide core functionalities, miscellaneous common  
 * 
 * As the system makes use of inheritance and has consistent class naming  
 * conventionsl it is generally easy to tell what category a particular class falls into.  
 * For example, a Data Access Object class always inherits from the DAO class, has a  
 * Class name of the form [Something]%DAO, and has a filename of the form  
 * [Something]%DAO.inc.php. 
 *
 * To learn more about developing OJS, there are several additional resources that may be useful:
 * - The docs/README document
 * - The PKP support forum at http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum
 * - The technical reference (and other documents), available at http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_documentation
