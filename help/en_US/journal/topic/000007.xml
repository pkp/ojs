		<![CDATA[<p>This system can support multi-lingual journals, as well as journals in languages other than English. Those languages that have been made available for the system by the Site Administrator are listed under Languages in Journal Management, and can in turn be selected for use with the journal site. If more than one language is selected under Supported Locales, visitors to the site will be able to toggle between languages via a drop-down menu in the navigation bar. Additionally, users will be able to enter form information in any enabled language.</p>]]>
