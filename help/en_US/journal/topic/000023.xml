Registered Readers receive a notification email with the publication of each issue, which includes the Table of Contents for that particular issue. On registering themselves with the journal, Authors are given the option of enrolling as Readers as well.</p><p>More information on Registering for a journal can be found {help_topic key="user.registerAndProfile" text="here"}.</p> ]]>
