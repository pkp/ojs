		<![CDATA[<p>Statics &amp; Reports provides the Journal Manager with the ability to extract information about the history of the journal's usage in two forms. First, under Statistics, year-by-year statistics are available for at-a-glance data on submissions, editorial practices, and users. Second, the Journal Manager can generate one of several types of reports on a specific range of dates.</p><p>There are four types of reports available:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Journal Report</strong>: Reports on all journal submissions in the given period.</li>
			<li><strong>Editor Report</strong>: Reports on submissions, grouped by Editor.</li>
			<li><strong>Review Report</strong>: Reports on submissions, grouped by Reviewer.</li>
			<li><strong>Section Report</strong>: Reports on submissions, grouped by Section.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These reports are generated in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format and should be opened using a spreadsheet application.</p>]]>
