		<![CDATA[<p>The Section Editor manages the Review and Editing of submissions to which they have been assigned. In some cases, a Section Editor who is assigned to see submissions through the {help_topic key="editorial.sectionEditorsRole.review" text="Review"} Process will also be responsible for seeing the submissions that are accepted through the {help_topic key="editorial.sectionEditorsRole.editing" text="Editing"} process (that is, through copyediting, layout, and proofreading). Often, however, Section Editors only work with the Review process, and an Editor, acting in the role of Section Editor, sees the submissions through the Editing process. The journal will have a policy on how the tasks are divided.</p>]]>
