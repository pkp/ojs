		<![CDATA[<p>The Journal Manager can select one or all of the generic optional links to appear as part of the set of tools, to appear in a frame to the right of all items in sections of the journal that are indexed (e.g., Articles and not Conference Announcements). The Journal Manager can also select a discipline- or area-based set of Reading Tools, shown as Related Items to be displayed. The Journal Manager can examine, edit, delete or add to the tools in each Related Items set by going to Related Item Sets, under Reading Tools.</p><p>The same set of Reading Tools appears with every item in the indexed sections of the journal. However, the Reading Tools use the indexing terms provided by the author to ensure that the materials found in the databases provided is relevant. The Journal Manager can change the selected Reading Tools at any point.</p>]]>
