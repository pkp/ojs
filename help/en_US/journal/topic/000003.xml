		<![CDATA[<p>This journal system uses a number of traditional journal publishing roles to carry out the publishing process. One person can be registered in more than one capacity, so that the journal could, for example, be run by one person serving in all roles except Reviewer and Author. More typically, a Journal Manager may also serve as an Editor and a Section Editor. Reviewers are often registered as Authors.</p><p><em>Access limited by role</em>. Each role has its own domain of access to the editorial and publishing process. For example, Authors and Reviewers go into their own individual space within the journal's website; and Section Editors are only allowed to see the submissions to which they have been assigned. This means that in principle, at least, there is no potential conflict if a Section Editor submits an article to the journal for review and possible publication.</p>]]>
