		<![CDATA[<p>This list includes everyone who is registered with this journal in some capacity. The Journal Manager has the ability to sign in as any registered user. This can be extremely helpful when trying to provide the user with assistance at a distance, because it allows the Journal Manager to gain a more precise sense of what may be going wrong.</p><p>From here, the Journal Manager can also enroll existing users from the OJS site as a whole, can create new users, and can sync enrollment between journals.</p>]]>
