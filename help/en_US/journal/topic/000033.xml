		<![CDATA[<p>The Merge Users feature, available from Journal Management under the Users heading, allows the Journal Manager to merge two user accounts into a single account, transferring edit assignments, submissions, and numerous other records from one account to the other and effectively deleting the first.</p>
		<p>The following items are transferred:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Article authorship</li>
				<li>Public comments on articles</li>
				<li>Article notes</li>
				<li>Editor assignments and decisions</li>
				<li>Review assignments</li>
				<li>Layout editor assignments</li>
				<li>Proofreader assignments</li>
				<li>Article email and event log entries</li>
				<li>Reviewer access keys</li>
				<li>Roles</li>
				<li>Subscriptions (please see below)</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The following items are <strong>not</strong> transferred:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sessions</li>
				<li>Notification status (i.e. whether the user has signed up to receive notifications about journal news)</li>
				<li>Editorial team memberships</li>
				<li>Section Editor status on sections</li>
				<li>User profile information (e.g. first name, last name, etc.)</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This feature should be used with caution, as it is not reversible and involves the transfer of records from one user to another.</p>
		<p>For subscriptions, the second user's subscription is transferred to the first user only if is valid and if the first user does not already have a valid subscription for a given journal.</p>]]>
