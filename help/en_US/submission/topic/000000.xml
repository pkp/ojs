		<![CDATA[<p>The journal provides Authors with the ability to upload their submission directly to the journal  website. Depending on the options chosen by the Journal Manager for this journal (Setup Step 4.1), Authors may have the option, on registering as an Author, of also registering as a Reviewer (to be called upon to undertake peer reviews of other submissions) and/or a Reader (to be notified of the Table of Contents new issue of the journal). On completing the registration process, the Author is taken directly to User Home, which lists the various roles the user has with this journal (e.g., Author, Reviewer, etc.). Clicking on the role of Author will take users to their submissions page, where a list of current and past submissions are listed, and where a new submission to the journal can be initiated. The submission process for Authors is broken down into five steps, with guidance provided at each step. Authors do not need to complete the five steps in one session, but can return to what will be listed as on the submissions table as "{translate key="submissions.incomplete"}".</p>]]>
