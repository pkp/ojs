		<![CDATA[<p>Submissions in this queue are subject to review and a decision by the Section Editor to accept or decline the submission. The extent of the review process is spelled out in the journal's Review Policy (e.g., Is every Section of the journal subject to Peer Review? How many peer Reviewers per submission?). When a Section Editor or an Editor clicks on a submission title in the In Review Queue, they are taken to the submission's Review page. If the Section Editor accepts a submission, it moves to the In Editing queue; if declined, it moves to the Archives.</p>]]>
