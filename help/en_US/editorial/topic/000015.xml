		<![CDATA[<p>Each submission to the journal enters the process in the Editors' Unassigned queue. To assign a submission in this list to a Section Editor, the Editor clicks on the submission's title. This takes the Editor to the appropriate Submission page where the Section Editor is assigned. When a submission is assigned to a Section Editor, it moves from the Unassigned Queue to In Review Queue.</p>]]>
