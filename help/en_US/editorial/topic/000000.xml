		<![CDATA[<p>The Editorial Process for a submission to the journal consists of a review, typically a blind peer review, followed by a section editor's decision to accept or decline the submission. If accepted in the Review stage of the Editorial Process, the submission then goes through the Editing stage which consists of copyediting, layout and proofreading. Then the submission is scheduled for publication in an issue of the journal. Depending on how the journal has been organized, the Editorial Process can be conducted by a single Editor or by a team of Editors, Sections Editors, Copyeditors, Layout Editors, and Proofreaders.</p>]]>
