		<![CDATA[<p>The Section Editor manages the Review of submissions, as well as the editing of those that are accepted. Depending on the journal's policies, the Section Editor initially assigned to a submission by an Editor may be asked only to see it through the Review stage, after which, if the submission is accepted, the Editor takes over (in the role of Section Editor). Or the Section Editor may be asked to see submissions through both the Review and, for those accepted, the Editing stages. The Section Editor is notified by an email from the Editor that they are being asked to see a submission through the editorial process.</p>]]>
