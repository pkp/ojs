		<![CDATA[<p>Section Editors usually manage the Review of submissions and the editing of those that are accepted. Depending on the journal's policies, however, a Section Editor initially assigned to a submission by an Editor may be asked only to see it through the Review stage, after which, if the submission is accepted, the Editor takes over (in the role of Section Editor). Editors send requests to Section Editors to see a submission through the editorial process.</p>]]>
