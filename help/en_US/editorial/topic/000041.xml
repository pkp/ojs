		<![CDATA[<p>The Author and Proofreader will proof the files in their various formats for typographical and formatting errors. They will record the corrections needed in the Corrections text-box, following the Proofreading Instructions. Once the Proofreader emails the Layout Editor that the proofing is complete, the Layout Editor returns to the Proof Formats in Layout and makes the necessary changes, deleting the files that are corrected and uploading the corrected versions. On completing this task, the Layout Editor may wish to add comments to the Corrections text-box (e.g. explaining a change), before clicking on the email icon under Complete which will lead to an email for notifying the Section Editor that the submission is ready to be scheduled for publication.</p>]]>
