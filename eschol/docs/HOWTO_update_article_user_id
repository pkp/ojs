The article import currently assigns user_id = 1 to all articles. 
This script fixes this by assigning the primary author's user ID to each articles record where possible.

**IMPORTANT** Be sure that the process described in ojs/eschol/docs/HOW_link_authors_users has been
run before doing this!

To run the script:

cd /apps/subi/apache/htdocs/ojs/eschol/utilities/
php -f article_user_id_update.php
