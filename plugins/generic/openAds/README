	=== phpAdsNew Plugin
	=====================


The phpAdsNew plugin integrates the display of phpAdsNew ads into the OJS user
interface.

In order to use this plugin, you must ensure the following directives are
properly configured in OJS's config.inc.php configuration file in the
[openads] section:

install_path: This should contain the full path to the phpAdsNew installation.

In order to place content ads, you must insert the tag {$adContent} (the tag
must appear exactly, and capitalization is important) anywhere in the article's
full-text (i.e. HTML) and/or abstract.
