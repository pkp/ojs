About
-----
This plugin for OJS 2 converts all textareas to WYSIWYG XHTML editors using the TinyMCE cross-browser Javascript editor (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/).  This allows authors, journal editors, etc. to enter valid XHTML into the various forms for more control over the appearance of their content.
