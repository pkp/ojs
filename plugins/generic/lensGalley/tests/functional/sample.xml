        <p>T cells discriminate between self and foreign antigenic peptides, displayed on antigen presenting cell surfaces, via the TCR. While the molecular interactions between TCR and its ligands are well characterized in vitro, quantitative measurements of these interactions in living cells are required to accurately resolve the physical mechanisms of TCR signaling. We report direct single molecule measurements of TCR triggering by agonist pMHC in hybrid junctions between live primary T cells and supported lipid membranes. Every pMHC:TCR complex over the entire cell is tracked while simultaneously monitoring the local membrane recruitment of ZAP70, as a readout of TCR triggering. Mean dwell times for pMHC:TCR molecular binding of 5 and 54 s were measured for two different pMHC:TCR systems. Single molecule measurements of the pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex indicate that TCR triggering is stoichiometric with agonist pMHC in a 1:1 ratio. Thus any signal amplification must occur downstream of TCR triggering.</p>

        <p>The immune system identifies and combats foreign objects, including pathogens, in the body. T cells are key components of the immune system, and each has a unique variant of a signalling complex known as the T cell receptor on its surface. T cells scan the surfaces of other cells in search of antigens, which are peptides (fragments of proteins) that derive from foreign pathogens such as viruses. Successful recognition of a foreign peptide leads to an immune response that, in most cases, ultimately rids the body of the pathogen. Most importantly, however, the immune system must be able to discriminate between peptides that are produced naturally in the body (‘self’ peptides) and foreign or ‘non-self’ peptides. This is challenging because self peptides may have similar structures to non-self peptides and are often much more abundant.</p>
        <p>Many models have been proposed to explain how T cells are able to detect just a few molecules of foreign peptide. According to some hypotheses the T cell receptors get together in clusters to function cooperatively; alternatively, it has been suggested that rapid binding of a foreign peptide to multiple T cell receptors sequentially can build up a strong signal. However, none of these phenomena have been directly observed.</p>
        <p>O'Donoghue et al. now image the interactions between T cell receptors and peptides bound to molecules called major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs), and show that T cell activation can occur when a single foreign peptide binds to a single receptor. These interactions are long-lived and ultimately result in the recruitment of ZAP70, which has an important role in the activation of T cells, to the complex formed by the T cell, the peptide and the MHC molecule. Therefore, any amplification of the activating signal transmitted by non-self peptides occurs following receptor binding, in contrast to previous models.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>An essential aspect of adaptive immunity is the ability of T cells to discriminate between structurally similar agonist and non-stimulatory self peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weiss and Littman, 1994</xref>). Fewer than 10 agonist pMHC molecules can trigger T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irvine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manz et al., 2011</xref>), and the signaling response occurs on a timescale of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18a">Huse et al., 2007</xref>). It has been recognized for decades that subtle, peptide-specific differences in binding parameters, especially kinetic rates for the pMHC and T cell receptor (TCR) reaction, seem to be the basis of antigen recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsui et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tian et al., 2007</xref>). Experimental correlations between molecular pMHC:TCR binding kinetics, typically determined from solution assays of soluble extracellular domains and bulk measurements of T cell activity, have provided the foundation for much of this understanding.</p>
      <p>From a physical point of view, the extreme sensitivity, selectivity, and apparent immunity to stochastic noise exhibited by TCR antigen recognition pose challenges to classical notions of ligand-receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Merwe and Dushek, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dustin and Groves, 2012</xref>). For example, the maximum affinity a TCR can have for self pMHC ligands (non-triggering) is sharply defined and close to the affinity threshold for foreign pMHC (triggering). Consequently, every TCR is likely to bind a subset of the ever-present self pMHC molecules with affinities differing only slightly from genuine foreign agonist pMHC. If TCR triggering and signaling were simply proportional to TCR occupancy by ligand, then the abundance of self pMHC could easily overwhelm genuine agonist signals, rendering this as an ineffective discriminatory mechanism. Alternatively, each engagement of pMHC with TCR (serial triggering; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>), perhaps with some minimum engagement time (kinetic proof reading; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKeithan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rabinowitz et al., 1996</xref>), might define the threshold for TCR triggering. Other proposed mechanisms elaborate further, suggesting (pseudo) heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irvine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krogsgaard et al., 2005</xref>) of self and agonist pMHC molecules or pMHC-independent forms of trans activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper and Qian, 2008</xref>) of multiple TCR by a single agonist pMHC may be at work. Proving or disproving any of these various possibilities based on current data is confounded by the vast difference between ensemble biochemical measurements and cell population behavior. Substantial ambiguity with respect to the actual molecular mechanisms responsible for antigen triggering of T cells remains. A physically accurate understanding of this remarkable process will require simultaneous observations of the molecular binding kinetics, stoichiometry, and movement of individual signaling complexes in living T cells.</p>
      <p>Here, we characterize the molecular interactions between pMHC and TCR, at the single molecule level, while simultaneously monitoring the local membrane recruitment of cytosolic Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) in live primary T cells. Every pMHC can be individually resolved and tracked for up to minutes before photobleaching by using a multi-timescale single molecule fluorescence imaging approach. Key to this strategy is the variable control of excitation light dose and exposure time to achieve hardware discrimination of molecular species with different mobilities. The pMHC molecules fall into two unambiguously distinguished classes: one undergoing fast random motion and the second moving slowly along linear trajectories. These slow moving pMHC are the bound pMHC:TCR complexes; they are only observed with agonist peptide and they spatially correlate with both TCR and recruitment of ZAP70. The linear trajectories of the pMHC:TCR complexes match the well-characterized cytoskeleton-driven movement of TCR during the formation of the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeMond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Thus a lone agonist pMHC bound to TCR leads to stable engagement of the resulting complex with the cytoskeleton. Single molecule intensity calibration of the number of ZAP70 recruited to the vicinity of each agonist pMHC indicates that TCR are triggered in a 1:1 stoichiometry with pMHC.</p>
      <p>Associations of pMHC with TCR exhibited molecular binding dwell times with mean durations of 53.8 ± 12.2 s and 5.2 ± 0.2 s for AND and 5c.c7 TCRs, respectively. Individual dwell times are roughly exponentially distributed and are in general agreement with bulk solution measurements of pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates for both TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newell et al., 2011</xref>). However, dwell times measured from tracking experiments specifically correspond to spatial entrapment of pMHC with a TCR, or cluster of TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schamel and Alarcon, 2013</xref>), on the T cell surface. They do not necessarily correspond to individual molecular binding events with a single TCR. Indeed, recent studies (e.g., by FRET) have suggested that pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates may be accelerated in living cells relative to in vitro measurements, possibly as a result of actively applied forces from the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). We explore the possibility that individual dwell times observed by tracking experiments could be composed of rapid unbinding and serial rebinding of pMHC to multiple TCR within a cluster. Results from a stochastic reaction-diffusion analysis, covering a wide range of parameter space, indicate that serial rebinding alone is unlikely to sustain entrapment. If pMHC thoroughly disengages from TCR, it will most likely escape. Structural flexibility within the pMHC:TCR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hawse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reboul et al., 2012</xref>) could give rise to apparently fast kinetics (e.g., in FRET measurements) without actual unbinding of pMHC from TCR. The tracking observations reported here directly reveal that the functional interaction between agonist pMHC and TCR is long-lived in living cells and that triggered TCR remain localized with the same pMHC.</p>

        <p>We probe agonist pMHC:TCR complex dynamics in hybrid live cell—supported membrane junctions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grakoui et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The supported membrane is functionalized with MHC (IE<sup>k</sup>) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 fusion with a blue fluorescent protein (ICAM1-TagBFP), both linked to the membrane via C-terminal poly-His tag binding to Ni-chelating lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nye and Groves, 2008</xref>). The MHC is loaded with peptide (moth cytochrome c [MCC] agonist or null), which is covalently coupled in a 1:1 stoichiometry (verified by HPLC) to the photostable fluorophores Atto647N or Atto488 using maleimide-thiol chemistry. Upon contact between the T cell and the supported membrane, Leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1)-ICAM1 binding leads to rapid cell spreading and formation of an essentially planar interface between the T cell and supported membrane, within which pMHC:TCR interactions occur.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00778.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Agonist pMHC binding to TCR in T cells is revealed by changes in mobility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the hybrid live cell–SLB system.

        <p>At fast exposure times (17.5 ms) and high excitation powers (0.2 W/cm<sup>2</sup>), all pMHC molecules are readily resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). The pMHC move as individual molecules, as identified by single-step photobleaching, and can be continuously tracked for up to hundreds of frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In regions without a cell, pMHC exclusively exhibit random diffusive motion. The step-size distribution from these trajectories corresponds to a single lateral diffusion coefficient of 0.44 (SEM = 0.002) µm<sup>2</sup>/s, which is typical for supported membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Within the T cell junction, the step-size distribution becomes bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition to a fast component from freely diffusing pMHC, a distinct slow-moving component also appears.</p>
        <p>At long exposure times (500 ms) and low excitation powers (0.02 W/cm<sup>2</sup>), the fast moving pMHC fraction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is averaged over several pixels to form a relatively homogenous background.

The slow moving pMHC molecules colocalize with TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and move in linear trajectories toward the geometric center of the live cell-supported membrane junction; these are the pMHC:TCR complexes. When MHC is loaded with a mixture of agonist and null peptides, with different fluorescent labels, only the agonist peptides are observed in the slow-moving complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The result is identical when the fluorophores are reversed, excluding the possibility that fluorophore effects could be responsible for binding.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife00778v001.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00778.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>A 3 s time-lapse video (189 frames) of agonist pMHC interacting with live 5c.c7 T cells (labeled with MCC-Atto488).</title><p>A long (500 ms) exposure time allows for unambiguous discrimination between TCR-bound and unbound agonist pMHC in the bilayer.

        <title>TCR triggering monitored by ZAP70 recruitment</title>
        <p>Two-color single molecule tracking is used to quantitatively monitor membrane recruitment of cytosolic ZAP70-EGFP (incorporated by retroviral transfection) to the locations of the pMHC:TCR complexes. Using a dual-view system in which chromatic aberrations have been mapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), spatial colocalization between the two channels to less than 105 nm is achieved. Immediately after cell landing, ZAP70 localizes to and moves together with the pMHC:TCR complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2 video3">Videos 2 and 3</xref>). For each frame in a tracking sequence, fluorescence intensity in the ZAP70-EGFP channel is integrated over a 315 nm square region centered on each pMHC:TCR complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The resulting intensity traces reveal discrete changes in average intensity, which we attribute to the binding of one ZAP70-EGFP to the phosphorylated ITAM domains on the cytoplasmic side of TCR engaged with pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwashima et al., 1994</xref>). Representative traces of colocalized ZAP70-EGFP intensity along with the corresponding intensity trace from the pMHC are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. Stochastic transitions are identified using a change-point algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ensign and Pande, 2009</xref>) and results from this analysis are superimposed on the raw intensity traces. Observed molecular binding dwell times of individual ZAP70-EGFP, as resolved by the stochastic transitions, range from 12 to 107 s. The majority of single molecule ZAP70-EGFP traces exhibit intensity fluctuations consistent with background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which would not be expected if cytosolic ZAP70-EGFP exchanged during exposure time. These dwell times are slightly longer than estimates of ∼10 s obtained from bulk fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunnell et al., 2002</xref>). However, those experiments also identified a slower-exchanging fraction of ZAP70 that was not included in the average.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00778.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>ZAP70 recruitment, stoichiometry, and movement are consistent with 1:1 agonist pMHC:TCR stoichiometry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A spatial map of MCC-Atto647N single molecule (red) and ZAP70-EGFP (blue) puncta.

Taken together, these observations indicate that rapid ZAP70-EGFP unbinding and rebinding in between observations is unlikely. If rapid unbinding/rebinding were to occur, then either single molecule ZAP70-EGFP traces would more frequent and shorter, or ZAP70-EGFP traces without single step intensity increases or decreases would be noisier.

However, the ZAP70-EGFP output for these traces is equivalent to the ZAP70-EGFP output for single agonist pMHC single molecule traces.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00778.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00778.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife00778fs002"/></fig></fig-group></p>
        <p>ZAP70-EGFP features brighter than single molecules are also observed and we calibrate their stoichiometries using single molecule ZAP70-EGFP intensities from the same cell. For example, the average ZAP70-EGFP feature intensity per frame (136.0 counts ± 0.04 SEM, integrated over a 315 nm square area for each feature) for the cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> corresponds to 2.9 ± 0.04 SEM ZAP70-EGFP per feature, given that the single molecule intensity is 47 ± 2 counts (SEM; n = 6) in that cell. Each feature therefore contains on average ∼6 ZAP70 molecules, since ZAP70-EGFP was expressed in a roughly 1:1 ratio with endogenous ZAP70 (selected by FACS and confirmed by western blotting) in these experiments. Each TCR complex has 10 ITAM domains that, when phosphorylated, can bind one ZAP70 each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weiss and Littman, 1994</xref>). Thus observation of ∼6 ZAP70 per agonist pMHC suggests only a single TCR is triggered.</p>
        <p>Brighter ZAP70-EGFP features tend to be located towards the geometric center of the cell at later time points (&gt;5–10 min after T cell landing). These can be tracked for tens to hundreds of seconds, indicating that recruited ZAP70-EGFP remain stably associated with the pMHC:TCR complex while traveling along the same linear trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2 video3">Videos 2 and 3</xref>). The observation of a range of ZAP70-EGFP stoichiometries (from 1 to ∼10 ZAP70-EGFP per pMHC:TCR complex) implies that some time-dependent accumulation of ZAP70 is likely to occur, although we have not definitively observed ZAP70-EGFP accumulation over time within individual intensity traces. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that engagement of TCR with an individual agonist pMHC molecule leads to stable association with the actin cytoskeleton, one-to-one TCR triggering (ITAM phosphorylation), and subsequent ZAP70 recruitment. Moreover, since every pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex is individually resolved in these experiments, we demonstrate that a single pMHC:TCR complex can lead to TCR triggering without molecular-scale association with other MHC molecules.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video2" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife00778v002.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00778.010</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Simultaneous observation of ZAP70-EGFP recruitment and pMHC:TCR binding immediately after a living AND T cell lands on the SLB.</title><p>ZAP70-EGFP membrane recruitment (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) and pMHC:TCR binding (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) occur almost immediately after landing.

        <p>Tracking observations reveal the time intervals over which individual agonist pMHC molecules remain physically trapped within the immediate vicinity of the same TCR. Thus, although our measured dwell times in live cells are in general agreement with bulk solution measurements of pMHC:TCR kinetic off-rates for both TCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newell et al., 2011</xref>), this may not result from the same reasons in each case. Unbinding of pMHC from TCR followed by rapid rebinding to the same TCR or another TCR within the same signaling cluster could conceivably lead to entrapment of pMHC for timescales longer than the lifetime of the molecular interaction. This has been hypothesized as a potential mode by which a small number of agonist pMHC could trigger a larger number of TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Govern et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, recently reported single molecule measurements of pMHC:TCR binding kinetics in live cells, by force probe and by FRET, have suggested accelerated kinetic-off rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>).

Even with a very fast <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub>, if pMHC completely disengages from TCR for long enough to diffuse to an adjacent TCR, then the probability of complete escape from the TCR cluster is high.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>All evidence reported here suggests that individual agonist pMHC remain bound to the same TCR for at least several seconds for the 5c.c7 TCR and for approximately one minute for the AND TCR in live cells. Subsequent recruitment of ZAP70 indicates TCR are triggered and movement of the complexes along linear trajectories confirms stable association with the actin cytoskeleton. All of this occurs as a result of a lone agonist pMHC binding TCR, without involvement of other MHC. The measured average pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 stoichiometry indicates TCR triggering is most likely 1:1 with agonist pMHC. Supernumerary triggering of multiple TCR by a single pMHC is not observed on the timescales of minutes investigated in these experiments. The original serial triggering model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>) drew its conclusions from the extent of TCR down regulation measured 5 hr after exposure of T cells to antigen-pulsed APCs. Additionally, the lack of molecular-scale cooperativity in TCR triggering by agonist pMHC indicates that observed cooperativity at the level of cellular calcium response, at similar ligand densities and timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manz et al., 2011</xref>), is most likely due to intracellular feedback mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Altan-Bonnet and Germain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5a">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8a">Das et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38a">Stefanová et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The timescales of the pMHC:TCR interactions we observe in live cells are consistent with SPR measurements of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> for the 5c.c7 TCR and 226 TCR, which is nearly identical to AND (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newell et al., 2011</xref>). They are also consistent with reports of a ∼2 s kinetic threshold for thymic selection determined in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palmer and Naeher, 2009</xref>). Stochastic reaction-diffusion analysis of the measured kinetic and mobility parameters indicates that rapid serial rebinding of agonist pMHC to multiple TCRs in a signaling cluster is unlikely to be a universal mechanism for ligand discrimination and rapid signal amplification in T cells.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00778.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Interaction of the 226 TCR with the MCC peptide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CDR3α (yellow) and CDR3β (orange) loops form all the specific interactions with the peptide (cyan).

      <p>The intercellular geometry as well as active processes within the T cell have long been suspected to influence pMHC:TCR interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shaw and Dustin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burroughs and Wulfing, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Direct in situ measurements of individual pMHC:TCR binding kinetics, such as we report here, are extremely limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axmann et al., 2012</xref>) but informative comparisons can be made. Notably, a recent intramolecular FRET study of the 5c.c7 TCR binding MCC pMHC reports short (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>∼150 ms) in situ 2D dwell times, nearly 35 times faster than the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> = 5.2 ± 0.2 s we measured by tracking. This same study measures <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> 25 times longer under conditions of cytoskeleton disruption, essentially in agreement with tracking observations. This result has been interpreted to mean that the actin cytoskeleton actively destabilizes agonist pMHC:TCR complexes. In contrast, we observe very small effects of actin disruption on agonist pMHC dwell times for AND and essentially no effect with 5c.c7 TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is conceivable that the agonist pMHC:TCR complex does not remain bound in the same structural configuration for the duration of engagement. If mechanical coupling to actin significantly reduces the apparent <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in a single molecule FRET measurement, but not in a single molecule tracking experiment, this raises the possibility that mechanical forces can induce conformational alterations in agonist pMHC:TCR without complete disengagement of the complex. Recent structural studies of pMHC:TCR indicate the possibility of such flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hawse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reboul et al., 2012</xref>). While putative conformational changes would not affect single-molecule tracking measurements, they could produce a FRET signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Majumdar et al., 2007</xref>). Under such a scenario, apparently fast <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> observed by FRET imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>) may not correspond to actual molecular unbinding and escape of agonist pMHC from TCR.</p>
      <p>In the aggregate, the data reported here indicate that spatially discrete pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complexes form according to molecular mass action laws with relatively predictable chemical kinetics and stoichiometry in living cells. The observed pMHC:TCR molecular binding kinetics mirror solution measurements and we observe no evidence for molecular scale cooperativity in the triggering of TCR by agonist pMHC (at low agonist density). Thus any amplification or other form of signal processing must occur downstream of TCR triggering.</p>

        <p>A plasmid containing enhanced green fluorescent protein fused to CD3 zeta-chain-associated protein of 70 kDa (<italic>Zap70-EGFP</italic>) was a gift of Takashi Saito, RIKEN Research Center for Allergy and Immunology, Yokohama, Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>Zap70-EGFP</italic> gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a murine stem cell virus parent vector (pMSCV).</p>
        <p>Bi-hexahistidine-tagged major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II I-E<sup>k</sup> protein was produced and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nye and Groves, 2008</xref>). A decahistidine-tagged <italic>ICAM1-TagBFP</italic> fusion protein was generated by PCR amplifying the TagBFP sequence (Evrogen Inc., Moscow, Russia) and subcloning it into a pN1-ICAM1 vector. The entire <italic>Icam1-TagBFP</italic> gene was then further subcloned into the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA), which was used to generate baculovirus for infection of High Five cells (Invitrogen Inc.). The ICAM1-TagBFP was subsequently purified on a Ni-NTA-agarose affinity column, eluted with an imidazole gradient, dialyzed, and stored in Tris buffer containing 10% glycerol. AND CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaye et al., 1989</xref>) and 5 c.c7 CD4+ T cells were harvested and cultured essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smoligovets et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>T cells were transduced with <italic>Zap70-EGFP</italic> and sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) according to viability and EGFP expression. The population of transduced cells that was used expressed EGFP at no more than 50% of the highest EGFP level in the overall EGFP-positive population.</p>

        <title>Peptide purification and labeling</title>
        <p>Using the basic sequence of moth cytochrome c (amino acids 88–103) and previously described variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>), the following peptides were synthesized by David King at the HHMI Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at UC Berkeley and/or commercially (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Hayward, CA): MCC (ANERADLIAYLKQATK), MCC(C) (ANERADLIAYLKQATKGGSC), MCC-null(C) (ANERAELIAYLTQAAKGGSC). For fluorophore labeling, cysteine-containing peptides were dissolved in a small amount of phosphate buffer and mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio with Atto 647N resuspended in a small amount of 1-propanol or lyophilized Atto 488 (Atto-Tec GmbH, Siegen, Germany) and labeled using maleimide-thiol chemistry. The peptides were then incubated at room temperature for at least 1 hr and purified on a C18 reverse phase column (Grace–Vydac, Deerfield, IL) and H<sub>2</sub>O:acetonitrile gradient using ÄKTA explorer 100 FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Peptide identity was confirmed after purification using mass spectrometry.</p>

        <title>Microscopy</title>
        <p>TIRF experiments were performed on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti; Technical Instruments, Burlingame, CA) using a custom-built laser launch with 488 nm (Sapphire HP; Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and 640 nm (Cube; Coherent Inc.) diode lasers, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Laser powers measured at the sample were 0.8 mW (640 nm) and 0.5 mW (488 nm) for 500 ms exposures and 4.4 mW (640 nm) for 17.5 ms exposures. A dichroic beamsplitter (z488/647rpc; Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT) reflected the laser light through the objective lens (Nikon 1.49 NA TIRF; Technical Instruments, Burlingame, CA) and fluorescence images were recorded using an EM-CCD (iXon 597DU; Andor Inc., South Windsor, CT) after passing through a laser-blocking filter (Z488/647 M; Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT). Bandpass filters (FF03 525/50; Semrock Inc., Rochester, NY and ET 700/75, Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT) were placed in a DualView 2 Simultaneous Imaging System (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ). Colors were registered before every two-color experiment by imaging 100 nm Tetraspec beads (Invitrogen Inc.) deposited on a coverslip patterned with a Cr grid with ∼80 nm width and 3–4 μm pitch Cr lines, since the Tetraspec beads preferentially bind the regular Cr pattern. Exposure times and time-lapse periods for most experiments were set using image collection software (MetaMorph 7.5; Molecular Devices Inc., Downingtown, PA), which drives an external shutter (Uniblitz LS6; Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Exposure time and Fast Kinetics Mode for short (17.5 ms) integration time experiments were set using Andor Solis (Andor Inc., South Windsor, CT). Exposure times were measured directly from the Fire output of the EM-CCD using an oscilloscope (TDS 210; Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton, OR).</p>

        <title>Imaging chamber and supported lipid bilayer preparation</title>
        <p>Single unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were formed by tip sonication of a solution composed of 98 mol % 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 2 mol % 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid) succinyl] (nickel salt) (Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA-DOGS) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in Mill-Q water (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Tip sonication was preferred to vesicle extrusion due to the introduction of significant levels of fluorescent impurities into the SUVs during extrusion. Prior to experiments, #2 40 mm diameter round coverslips were ultrasonicated for 30 min in 50:50 isopropyl alcohol:water, rinsed thoroughly in Milli-Q water (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), etched for 5 min in piranha solution (3:1 sulfuric acid:hydrogen peroxide), and again rinsed thoroughly in Milli-Q water. The coverslips were used in the assembly of FCS2 Closed Chamber Systems (flow cells; Bioptechs, Butler, PA), which were pre-filled with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 19.98 mM Tris, 136 mM NaCl, pH 7.4; Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA). SUVs were then flowed into the chambers, and bilayers were allowed to form for at least 30 min. The bilayers were rinsed once with TBS, incubated for 5 min with 100 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> in TBS, rinsed with TBS, and then rinsed with a T cell imaging buffer composed of 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 6 mM d-glucose, and 1% wt/vol bovine serum albumin. 48 hr prior to experiments, MHC was loaded with peptide at 37°C in a buffer composed of 1% wt/vol bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and brought to pH 4.5 with citric acid. Unbound peptide was separated from peptide loaded MHC (pMHC) using 10k spin concentrators (Amicon Ultra, Cork, Ireland) and then pMHC was diluted in imaging buffer. ICAM1-TagBFP and pMHC were further diluted with imaging buffer, introduced into the flow cells, and incubated for 35 min followed by a rinse with imaging buffer. T cells resuspended in imaging buffer and added to the flow cells 35 min after the final rinse and imaged immediately for 30–60 min. To visualize TCR, T cells were incubated in a solution of 1 μl Alexa 647 (Invitrogen Inc.)-labeled H57 anti-TCR Fab and 100 μl imaging buffer for 20 min at 4°C prior to the regular imaging buffer resuspension. All other incubations during this protocol were performed at room temperature, and imaging experiments were performed at 37°C.</p>

        <title>Data analysis</title>
        <p>Single molecule diffraction-limited spots were detected in raw .tif image stacks of agonist pMHC labeled with MCC-Atto488 and MCC-647N molecules by filtering for both size and intensity and linked into tracks using published particle detection and tracking algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crocker and Grier, 1996</xref>) adapted for MATLAB (The Mathworks; Natick, MA) by Daniel Blair and Eric Dufresne (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/">http://physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/</ext-link>; accessed 16 August 2012). Size and intensity thresholds were first determined by eye using a test data set and then applied uniformly to all data collected with the same exposure time and incident laser intensities. Single molecules were identified by step photobleaching detected in an automated way using a Bayesian change point detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ensign and Pande, 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>The brightness of ZAP70-EGFP features varies from a single molecule to several molecules, and different brightness features are detected using slightly different methods, despite the fact that the features are physically similar. Bright ZAP70-EGFP features (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>) were detected using the same algorithm as is used for single molecule pMHC. The lower signal-to-noise single molecule ZAP70-EGFP intensity traces like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> were obtained by summing the intensity of the ZAP70-EGFP channel using the agonist pMHC (labeled with Atto647N) molecule position as a mask, as is explained in the main text.</p>
        <p>The lifetime of the bright ZAP70-EGFP speckles is difficult to accurately assess due to the fluctuating background and varying speckle intensity (which biases measurement towards brighter, longer-lived fluorescent features), but speckle lifetimes appear to be longer than the single molecule ZAP70-EGFP lifetimes. Single molecule ZAP70-EGFP molecules are uncorrected for photobleaching of both ZAP70-EGFP and agonist pMHC and therefore the range of binding times reported (12–107 s) only serves as a lower bound for the molecular ZAP70 dwell time.</p>
        <p>The agonist pMHC step size distribution at 17.5 ms resolution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is populated using similar particle detection and tracking methods to the 500 ms resolution analysis., Agonist pMHC:TCR binding kinetics cannot be uniquely inferred from the step size distribution, since the step size distribution is a time-independent analysis. For instance, the step size distribution measured over a certain time period with 2<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> and 2<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> would appear identical to a scenario with <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>.</p>

Note that since <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf52"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">on</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">esc</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf54"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is equivalent to the TCR cluster size. This relationship between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">esc</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">off</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and TCR cluster size can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. It is possible that agonist pMHC binding interactions with CD4 could slow the mobility of an individual agonist pMHC within a TCR cluster relative to <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>SLB</italic></sub> when the agonist pMHC are unbound from TCR. This could hypothetically lead to entrapment and long single molecule tracks (like those reported here) in the absence of direct, sustained agonist pMHC-TCR interactions. While such a mechanism is conceivable, there is no direct evidence for such a tethering mechanism in the literature.</p>

      <p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Direct single molecule measurement of TCR triggering by agonist pMHC in living primary T cells” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p>
      <p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p>
      <p>Overall, this is an outstanding study, one that has made a number of technical breakthroughs and emerges with interesting results. The authors examine the interactions between pMHC and TCR, at a single molecule level, which provides a direct measurement on the association times of this complex. They also examine how the pMHC-TCR complex recruits ZAP70, which is a direct measure of triggering and the initiation of signal transduction. This is a very nicely executed two color, single molecule experiment. There are several interesting findings: 1) the TCR-pMHC act as discrete entities and do not appear to aggregate; 2) the association times differ 10-fold for two different peptide agonists, revealing distinct information encoded by off-rates; 3) the dissociation rates are much slower than was previously reported by a live cell FRET measurement (the new data are more direct and believable, and the information will be important for the field); 4) Virtually all pMHC-TCR complexes become immobilized and hook onto the actin cytoskeleton; and 5) each pMHC-TCR recruits several ZAP70 molecules and these complexes also are extremely long lived.</p>
      <p>Major comments:</p>
      <p>1) This manuscript follows others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>) that have tried to address this problem and come away with interesting insights. The current study takes a unique approach using low intensity light for longer time periods, which selects against short-term interactions to track TCR-PMHC interactions and comes up with some contradictions with the published work. These differences to the previously published results are puzzling and need to be discussed.</p>
      <p>2) There is not much of a difference between 24 and 37 degrees. This is surprising and should be discussed.</p>
      <p>3) The Introduction could be improved for a general audience. Currently it reads like a longer version of the Abstract (or a shorter version of the Results). This section would be a good place to set up the main issues of the paper, e.g., why off-rates are important and what attempts have been made to measure this in the past. Also a few small points – are all pMHC-TCR-Zap70 complexes attached to actin or is there evidence of them being formed, diffusion, and then joining onto the actin treadmill? Can one detect variability or successive recruitment of Zap70? It is stated that there is an average of 6 but we are wondering if one could extract additional information at the single molecule level of clear variability (particularly for two different pMHC) or accumulation of Zap70 over time.</p>

      <p><italic>1) This manuscript follows others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>) that have tried to address this problem and come away with interesting insights. The current study takes a unique approach using low intensity light for longer time periods, which selects against short-term interactions to track TCR-PMHC interactions and comes up with some contradictions with the published work. These differences to the previously published results are puzzling and need to be discussed</italic>.</p>
      <p>The differing results with respect to in situ pMHC:TCR kinetics observed by tracking in our experiments and by smFRET in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppa et al., 2010</xref> paper are indeed puzzling. Several key points regarding this issue are contained in the original manuscript. We highlight these below and have made additional clarifications in the text (e.g., paragraph 1 in “Single molecule agonist pMHC:TCR binding kinetics”).</p>
      <p>The variable exposure times used in our experiments allow observations to be directed at different time scales. Thus although much of the data presented was acquired under conditions that do indeed select against short-term interactions, we have also done the corresponding high-speed measurements (see, for example, the single molecule trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The fast pMHC:TCR kinetics reported in Huppa et al., are still an order of magnitude slower than our fastest time resolution (17.5 ms); such fast events are not likely to be missed in these tracking experiments using the fast exposure times.</p>
      <p>We devote several analyses in the manuscript towards possible differences in what is measured by tracking vs. smFRET. Specifically, we consider (and rule out) serial rebinding of a single pMHC to multiple TCR in a TCR cluster (“Stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations”). In the Discussion (paragraphs 3 and 4) we suggest structural flexibility within the pMHC:TCR complex could explain the differing observations, particularly since the fast kinetics are only observed when the pMHC:TCR complexes are under strain. This could easily obliterate a smFRET signal even without the complex fully disengaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Majumdar et al., 2007</xref>). Such flexibility is supported by recent structural analyses of pMHC:TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hawse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reboul et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, with the information at hand, we suggest this is the most likely explanation. It is important to note that our measurements agree with solution SPR measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corse et al. 2010</xref> &amp; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newell et al. 2011</xref>) and with in vivo requirements for negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palmer &amp; Naeher, 2009</xref>) for two different TCR. We do not analyze measurements made with a different pMHC:TCR combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>) in detail because they are not directly comparable.</p>
      <p><italic>2) There is not much of a difference between 24 and 37 degrees. This is surprising and should be discussed</italic>.</p>
      <p>There is only a modest difference between dwell times measured at 24 and 37°C. The difference is more pronounced for the MCC-AND interaction, 54 s vs 81 s at 24 and 37°C, respectively. We observe a slight temperature effect in the 5c.c7 system; however, the intrinsic experimental error in comparing the dwell time distributions at 24 and 37°C is higher for shorter interactions. The effect is also easier to see for the MCC-AND interaction because there are more MCC-AND complexes per T cell (data not shown). It is also possible that changes in cellular behavior in response to temperature could also affect these measurements in ways that are not observed in solution measurements with purified components. At 24°C T cells have a smaller surface area on the supported membrane than at 37°C, are slower to land, and also have decreased lamellipodial motion. These factors could affect the environment of the pMHC:TCR interaction in unpredictable ways and perhaps could compensate for the direct temperature effect on molecular interactions.</p>
      <p><italic>3) The Introduction could be improved for a general audience. Currently it reads like a longer version of the Abstract (or a shorter version of the Results). This section would be a good place to set up the main issues of the paper, e.g., why off-rates are important and what attempts have been made to measure this in the past</italic>.</p>
      <p>We have expanded and clarified the Introduction to better introduce the importance of quantitative single molecule measurements (e.g., of kinetic off-rate, stoichiometry, etc.) to the understanding of TCR signaling mechanisms.</p>
      <p><italic>Also a few small points – are all pMHC-TCR-Zap70 complexes attached to actin or is there evidence of them being formed, diffusion, and then joining onto the actin treadmill? Can one detect variability or successive recruitment of Zap70? It is stated that there is an average of 6 but we are wondering if one could extract additional information at the single molecule level of clear variability (particularly for two different pMHC) or accumulation of Zap70 over time</italic>.</p>
      <p>All observed pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complexes are transported radially towards the geometric cell center (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1 video2 video3">Videos 1, 2, and 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) of the 2-dimensional cell-supported membrane interface. We do not observe evidence for pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 random diffusion prior to radial transport on these timescales – such sequential events could occur on faster timescales.</p>
      <p>Clear variability does exist in the number of ZAP70-EGFP per pMHC:TCR complex. This is most clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, where the intensity distribution of ZAP70-EGFP puncta is symmetric and unimodal with an average of 2.9 ZAP70-EGFP/puncta. The distribution of ZAP70-EGFP intensities (from single ZAP70 molecules up to ∼10) implies that time-dependent ZAP70-EGFP accumulation must occur, but we have not definitively observed accumulation of ZAP70-EGFP over time in one intensity trace. The observation of single molecule ZAP70-EGFP accumulation in a single intensity trace (i.e., several consecutive step intensity increases) is technically challenging due to the convolution of several time-dependent processes: MCC-Atto647N bleaching, ZAP70-EGFP bleaching, pMHC:TCR unbinding, ZAP70-ITAM binding, and ZAP70-ITAM unbinding. We do, however, make the bulk observation that the brightest ZAP70-EGFP features are observed at later time points. The text has been clarified accordingly (“TCR triggering monitored by ZAP70 recruitment”).</p>
