			<search_title>SMEALSearch</search_title>
			<search_description>SMEALSearch is a publicly available vertical digital library and search engine hosted at Penn State's Smeal College of Business that focuses on academic business documents. SmealSearch crawls the web and harvests, catalogs, and indexes academic business documents. It is based on the computer and information science engine, CiteSeer, initially developed at NEC Research Institute by Kurt Bollacker, Lee Giles and Steve Lawrence. The search engine crawls websites of academia, commerce, research institutes, government agencies, etc. for academic business documents, including published articles, working papers, white papers, consulting reports, etc. For certain documents, SmealSearch only indexes and stores the hyperlinks to those documents. SMEALSearch generates a citation analysis for all the academic articles harvested and ranks them in order of their citation rates (the most cited articles are listed first) similar to the ranking of CiteSeer and the Google Scholar.</search_description>
