			<search_title>Agricultural Conferences, Meetings, Seminars Calendar</search_title>
			<search_description>This calendar strives to include all major national and international agricultural meetings and others of apparent scientific importance. We will incorporate local level meetings only when they seem to be scientifically significant. Meetings outside our purview will be left to appropriate local, regional, or organization-specific calendars. We do plan to create links to such calendars when they are available. Provides a central repository for information and links to information concerning upcoming agricultural conferences, with emphasis on those of scientific significance.</search_description>
