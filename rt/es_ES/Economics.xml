			<search_description>This interactive glossary is written by Peter Meyer, a grad student at Northwestern University. As he describes it, "The guiding principle is that any term used in any English-language economics research journal that is neither defined there, nor common vocabulary among the mathematically literate belongs here." Links are given to the relevant citations (which are also available as one file), and all told it contains more than 1,000 entries. Grad students and researchers working in new areas are likely to find it useful. </search_description>
